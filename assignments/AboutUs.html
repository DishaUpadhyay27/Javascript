			<p>The key to decorating with one colour on walls and furniture is to use different shades of the same colour together, such as a soft apple green sofa alongside emerald metal side tables. It?s also a good idea to mix textures, for example combining matt paint on walls with a sleek, glossy lamp base. Try and work your colour scheme into all areas of your living room - such as your bay windows.Get living room color ideas and spring decorating ideas with these pictures of decor for spring living rooms.Are you painting a large room, perhaps two? You may want to spread the project over two days, such as a weekend. Prepare the room(s) on day one and save the actual painting for day two. If you're feeling ambitious and want to tackle it all in one day, pace yourself and try not to cut any corners during the prep stage.
Choose the right painting clothes. Wear something you won't mind getting paint on, like an old pair of jeans and a t-shirt. Don't forget to reward yourself (and anyone who helped). Make sure you wash your hands after your prep and paint work and then consider ordering a pizza to celebrate your progress after a productive dayGet living room color ideas and spring decorating ideas with these pictures of decor for spring living rooms.Are you painting a large room, perhaps two?
