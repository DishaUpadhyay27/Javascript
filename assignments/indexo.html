It?s also a good idea to mix textures, for example combining matt paint on walls with a sleek, glossy lamp base. Try and work your colour scheme into all areas of your living room - such as your bay windows.Get living room color ideas and spring decorating ideas with these pictures of decor for spring living rooms.Are you painting a large room, perhaps two?
